# Workplace-Planner

## Description

Simple workplace planner for a 9 a.m.- 5 p.m. day. 

## Usage

When the application is loaded a header with the current date and time will be shown, as well as the scheduler. Simply input your event within one of the time blocks and click the "save" button to the right of that time block to save an event. Your event will be saved to local storage, when the page is refreshed the app will restrieve your event from local storage. 

To delete an event delete the input of choice and click the save button next to the timeblock. 

Each timeblock is color coded by time of day. If the time is in the past the timeblock will be grey, if it's the current hour the timeblock will be red, if the time is in the future the block will be green.
